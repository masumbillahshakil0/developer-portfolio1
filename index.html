                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't
                    stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know
                    the
                    deployment,
                    server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                <p>
                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them.
                    They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
